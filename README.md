# Vigenere Cipher Decryption

Project Description:
-This project is meant to decrypt and encrypt a message inputted by the user using an implemented key. 
  - We will be encrypting the given message by using the Ei = (Pi + Ki) mod 26 and Di = (Ei - Ki + 26) mod 26 equation and implimenting it into our program using simple terms. We     will then use for loops for the equation and the if statements for the keyword.

- Instructions: To use this program, you will need to input any message you like in all caps and with no space. It can be a sentence or a singular word. It's your choice. The program will then encrypt the message and print out the inputted message, the keyword, and the encryption.
